PROJECT DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------

This is a lightweight AI Math Tutor Agent that uses a simple rule-based interface combined with NLP and algebra logic to help users solve linear equations and practice basic algebra through an interactive quiz mode.

The agent was developed in a Jupyter Notebook environment using Python and PyTorch. It supports user input for solving equations like "x + 2 = 5" and also offers randomly generated math quizzes for practice. The system can evaluate and validate answers, parse user expressions, and provide feedback on performance.

The project focuses on simplicity, accessibility, and ease of understanding, making it suitable as an educational AI assistant prototype.

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------

Open the notebook file Final_Jupyter_Notebook.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible interface (e.g., JupyterLab, VS Code).

1. Run all cells from top to bottom.
2. At the end of the notebook, type your command when prompted with 'You:' and follow the instructions.
3. The agent will respond based on your input. Type 'quit' to exit.

DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
--------------------------------------------------

1. Python 3.10+
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Core libraries used:
	a. sympy (symbolic math)
